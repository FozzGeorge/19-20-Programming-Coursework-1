- I encountered a problem in fully understanding the "FixedUpdate" function. I hadn't ever encountered this previously. 
If “update” runs once per frame, and then that frame is rendered, FixedUpdate runs as many times as needed to catch the physics 
simulation up.

- I initially encountered problems with the enemy AI's projectile not chasing the player, and could not understand why. 
Eventually, I realised it required the simplest fix, and I’d forgotten to change the player’s tag to “Player”. 
This is a simple, yet common mistake and one that I am thankful to have encountered, simply because I will now remember to 
always check tags.

- I initially wanted the player to be able to fire projectiles at the enemy, but decided aginst this as it made for confusing gameplay.
Instead I stuck with the mechanic of the enemy firing at the player, and implemented a scoring system for the player to get.
